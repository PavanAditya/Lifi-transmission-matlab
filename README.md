# Audio and Video Transmission through Li-Fi
A Matlab project built using MATLAB-C language for transmitting audio and video using Light as medium. 

It accepts video as input - divides that to images - converts them to greyscale from RGB - converts them to binary from greyscale
- transmits them to the receiver through LED - the same decoding process is done at the receiver side and the video is played.
Since light is being used as a medium for the transmission this is called Data transmission through Li-Fi
